# Washington Post Newspaper Auto Summarization

This project focuses on automatically generating summaries for news articles from The Washington Post. The goal is to extract key information and provide concise summaries that capture the main points of the articles, making it easier for users to quickly grasp the content and decide whether they want to read the full article.

## Project Overview

The project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze news articles from The Washington Post. It involves the following components:

1. Data Collection: The project collects news articles from The Washington Post by utilizing beautifulsoup library.

2. Text Preprocessing: The collected articles undergo text preprocessing to clean the text, remove irrelevant content (e.g., advertisements or comments), and tokenize the text into sentences or paragraphs.

3. Auto Summarization: The auto summarization component focuses on generating concise summaries of the news articles. It utilizes techniques such as extractive summarization, which selects important sentences or phrases from the original text, or abstractive summarization, which generates summaries by understanding the content.


## Key Features

- Collects news articles from The Washington Post using web scraping.
- Preprocesses the articles by cleaning the text, removing irrelevant content, and tokenizing the text.
- Implements extractive or abstractive summarization techniques to generate concise summaries.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries (NLTK, SpaCy)
- Beautiful Soup (for web scraping)

## Dataset

The project requires a dataset of Washington Post news articles to perform auto summarization. The articles can be collected using web scraping techniques.

## Future Plans

- Improve the accuracy and coherence of the auto summarization process by exploring advanced techniques like pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT, GPT) or reinforcement learning-based approaches.
- Incorporate user feedback and preferences to customize the summarization process based on individual needs.
- Extend the project to include other news sources and develop a generalized news summarization system.
