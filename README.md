# NLP Repository
This repository contains my Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects that involve text analysis, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and building chatbots.

## Projects
### 1. Newspaper Topic Modelling and Auto Summarization
* In this project, I have scraped news articles from a website and performed topic modeling and auto-summarization on them. 
* The main objective was to classify the articles based on their content to help viewers make decisions about whether the article is relevant to their interests or not. 
* I used various techniques such as TF-IDF, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and TextRank algorithms to extract key topics and summaries from the articles.

### 2. Twitter Sentiment Analysis
* In this project, I have analyzed tweets from a Twitter dataset to rate how positive or negative a topic is and hence the overall sentiment about the topic.
*  I used Natural Language Processing techniques such as tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming, and sentiment analysis to extract and analyze the tweets. 
*  I used various machine learning classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XG Boost, and SVM for the sentiment classification.

### 3. Chatbot for Restaurant using RASA
* In this project, I have built a chatbot for a restaurant using RASA framework. The chatbot can handle customer queries related to restaurant information such as menu, location, timings, etc.
*  I have trained the chatbot on a dataset of restaurant-related queries and responses and used RASA NLU and Core components for the training. The chatbot can be deployed on a website or a messaging platform.

### Technologies Used
Python
RASA Framework
Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Future Work
I plan to continue exploring NLP techniques and tools to build more advanced projects such as language translation models, chatbots with voice recognition, and sentiment analysis of audio and video content. I also plan to experiment with more advanced deep learning models such as BERT and GPT-3 for NLP tasks.
